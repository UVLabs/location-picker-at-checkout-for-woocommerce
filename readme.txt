Kikote - Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce enables store owners to get more precise location details without having to contact customers via other means for location information or directions. With this plugin, lots of time can be saved by allowing customers to select their exact location on Google Maps at checkout with WooCommerce.

## How Can Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce Help Me?

Kikote is a Checkout Location Picker plugin for WooCommerce that is suitable for any website that offers Delivery or Pickups for their customers. A Delivery website example would be an online restaurant, a Pickup website example would be a private taxi website. The plugin adds a Google map on the WooCommerce checkout page that customers can use to select their desired location. Alternatively, the plugin can be set up to also allow it to automatically detect the customer's location on checkout page load and allow them to make any corrections

Kikote - Location Picker at Checkout makes use of the Google Maps API to carry out it's functions; it can work as any of the following:

### WooCommerce Checkout Map Plugin 

This plugin adds a Google Map to the checkout page of WooCommerce which customers can use to select their location whether for deliveries or pickups.

### WooCommerce Billing & Shipping Address AutoFill Plugin

Kikote can work as a checkout address autofill for WooCommerce making it a full-featured autocomplete address and location picker for WooCommerce plugin. It can automatically fill in the WooCommerce checkout fields with the information pulled from the Google map or from the Google Places API. Save users some typing while pulling accurate address information.

### WooCommerce Shipping Zones (Regions) by Drawing Plugin

Kikote comes with a PREMIUM Shipping Zones by Drawing feature for WooCommerce which lets store owners draw custom shipping regions. Drawn shipping regions can have a name, price and background color. It's also possible to display the shipping regions on the checkout page's google map so customers can see the cost for shipping to different regions.

During checkout, if a customer location falls within a shipping region, the cost set for that shipping region will automatically be set as the shipping fee for the customer.

Create as many shipping zones and draw as many shipping regions as you like. Kikote will automatically set the cost of the shipping method once a customer falls within those drawn regions.

Optionally, set Kikote to only allow customers to place an order if their geolocation falls within shipping zones/regions that you draw.

### WooCommerce Shipping Cost by Distance Plugin

Kikote is a robust WooCommerce checkout location picker plugin that also allows you to calculate the shipping cost for a customer's order based on how far away that customer is from your location. Simply set the cost per Kilometer or Mile and let Kikote do the rest.

Optionally, set Kikote to only allow customers to place an order if their geolocation falls within a maximum distance that you have set for shipping.

### WooCommerce Shipping Cost by Store Plugin

Does your store have multiple locations(branches, pickup spots) ? Great! Set the cost for each of your store locations and let customers select which one they'd like their order to originate from. The shipping price will update based on the store location selected.

### WooCommerce Restaurant & Food Delivery Plugin

Kikote is excellent for online restaurants or food delivery websites that deliver customer orders after they have been placed. You can also create mulitple store locations that customers can select from at checkout if you business has multiple branches!

### WooCommerce Pickup Plugin

If you ran a website where customers select their location for pickup then Location Picker at Checkout for WooCommerce(Kikote) would be a suitable plugin for your website.

### WooCommerce Autocomplete/Autofill Checkout Address Plugin

Though the primary focus of the plugin is to allow customers to select accurate locations by using a map. Location Picker at Checkout for WooCommerce also allows store owners to enable the Places autocomplete feature on their checkout address fields. This feature shows customers address predictions as they type in their address. When a customer clicks the desired address from the dropdown, it can also automatically fill in the rest of the checkout fields. This feature is also known as Google Address Autofill.

### Saved Addresses for WooCommerce Plugin

Allow customers to save multiple different addresses to their account that they can select from when placing an order. This feature is useful for customers who might be placing orders on your store from multiple locations. 

A customer placing an order might not always be at the previously used address, with this feature they can select any previously saved address such as "Work", "Home", "Grandma's" etc. Think of it as an address book for WooCommerce.

### WooCommerce Custom Shipping Zones Plugin

The PRO version of Kikote allows you to create custom shipping zones by drawing them on a Google Map. These Zones can each have their own shipping cost and you can additionally prevent customers from checking out if they do not fall in any of the custom shipping zones.

### WooCommerce Delivery Area Plugin

Kikote comes with multiple features to fine tune where you deliver to and how much you wish to charge. These include features such as "Cost by Distance", "Cost by Distance Range", "Cost by Region", "Cost by Store Distance", Maximum shipping distance, as well as Cost by Store.

### WooCommerce Map Plugin

The plugin comes with a Map Builder feature that allows store owners to create custom Google Maps with their store locations and shipping regions and add those maps anywhere on their website using a shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The map doesn't show =

Ensure that you have setup the plugin with your API key by going to WordPress Dashboard->WooCommerce->Location Picker At Checkout. See [this doc](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/) for getting your API key. 
If you've entered your API key and the map still doesn't show, then please have a look at your [browser console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/#apple-safari) for any errors relating to the map, you can submit an issue thread on the plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/map-location-picker-at-checkout-for-woocommerce/)

If you're using Cloudflare's Rocket Loader feature then theres chances the map will not sure due to the changes Cloudflare does.

= Plugin settings not showing on WordPress Multisite =

Please ensure that both WooCommerce and Kikote are NOT activated Network-wide. Both of these plugins need to be activated on the specific sites they are needed and not network-wide activated.

= Nothing happens when I click on the map =

These sorts of issues are usually due to a JavaScript issue on the website. Check your [browser console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/) for any errors that might point to the cause. Feel free to post those errors in the support forum and include a full screenshot of your browser console.

= What happens if customer denies access to their location =

An alert will be shown informing the customer to select their location manually on the google map.

= Map says "For development purposes only" =

This message shows when you have not finished setting up the map correctly inside the Google Cloud Console. Please make sure you've followed all the steps from the [setup guide](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/) including the "Setting up Billing & Google Monthly Credit" section.

= Map shows "Oops! Something went wrong." =

This is usually shown when the domain you restricted inside google cloud console is wrong. Make sure you've restricted the correct domain. [See here for instructions](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/#important-restricting-your-api-key). 

This message shows when you have not finished setting up the map correctly inside the Google Cloud Console. Please make sure you've followed all the steps from the [setup guide](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/) including the "Setting up Billing & Google Monthly Credit" section.

= Do I need to pay to use this plugin? =

No! The plugin is free to use. The Google Maps APIs it uses, however, do require you to setup an account on Google's Cloud Console. The process is easy and requires you also attaching a billing method to your account. Google provides a $200 monthly credit for usage of their APIs so you don't have to worry about paying anything unless you receive alot of orders on your store (upwards of 15,000 orders in a month). See [this step](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/#important-setting-up-billing-google-monthly-credit) in the setup guide for more details about how this works.

You are more than welcome to help translate the plugin into your language [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/map-location-picker-at-checkout-for-woocommerce/)
