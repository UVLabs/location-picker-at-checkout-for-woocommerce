Let WooCommerce customers set their exact location for delivery or pickup on Google Maps at checkout.

== Description ==

Do you run a WooCommerce store where you need more detailed location information from a customer? If so, then why not let them choose their exact location on Google Maps? 

Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce(LPAC) allows store owners to add more flexibility to their WooCommerce store by letting their customers choose exactly where they'd like their product(s) delivered. This plugin is excellent for stores with delivery personnel that ship products to customers within a moderate geographical area. It can also work for websites which offer Pickup services such as Private Taxi websites.

Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce(LPAC) enables store owners to get more precise location details without having to contact customers via other means for location information or directions. With this plugin, lots of time can be saved by allowing customers to select their exact location on Google Maps at checkout with WooCommerce.

## How Can Location Picker At Checkout for WooCommerce Help Me?

LPAC is a Checkout Location Picker plugin for WooCommerce that is suitable for any website that offers Delivery or Pickups for their customers. A Delivery website example would be an online restaurant, a Pickup website example would be a private taxi website. The plugin adds a Google map on the WooCommerce checkout page that customers can use to select their desired location. Alternatively, the plugin can be set up to also allow it to automatically detect the customer's location on checkout page load and allow them to make any corrections. 

The plugin makes use of the Google Maps API to carry out it's functions; it can work as any of the following:

### WooCommerce Checkout Map Plugin 

This plugin adds a Google Map to the checkout page of WooCommerce which customers can use to select their location whether for deliveries or pickups.

### WooCommerce Billing & Shipping Address AutoFill Plugin

This plugin has built-in support for automatically filling in the WooCommerce checkout fields with the information pulled from the Google map. Save users some typing while pulling accurate address information.

### WooCommerce Restaurant & Food Delivery Plugin

This plugin is excellent for online restaurants or food delivery websites that deliver customer orders after they have been placed.

### WooCommerce Pickup Plugin

If you ran a website where customers select their location for pickup then Location Picker at Checkout for WooCommerce(LPAC) would be a suitable plugin for your website.

### WooCommerce Autocomplete Checkout Address Plugin

Though the primary focus of the plugin is to allow customers to select accurate locations by using a map. Location Picker at Checkout for WooCommerce also allows store owners to enable the Places autocomplete feature on their checkout address fields. This feature shows customers address predictions as they type in their address. When a customer clicks the desired address from the dropdown, it can also automatically fill in the rest of the checkout fields.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The map doesn't show =

Ensure that you have setup the plugin with your API key by going to WordPress Dashboard->WooCommerce->Location Picker At Checkout. See [this doc](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/) for getting your API key. If you've entered your API key and the map still doesn't show, then please have a look at your  [browser console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/#apple-safari) for any errors relating to the map, you can submit an issue thread on the plugin's [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/map-location-picker-at-checkout-for-woocommerce/)

= Nothing happens when I click on the map =

These sorts of issues are usually due to a JavaScript issue on the website. Check your [browser console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/#apple-safari) for any errors that might point to the cause. Feel free to post those errors in the support forum and include a full screenshot of your browser console.

= Map says "For development purposes only" =

This message shows when you have not finished setting up the map correctly inside the Google Cloud Console. Please make sure you've followed all the steps from the [setup guide](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/) including the "Setting up Billing & Google Monthly Credit" section.

= Do I need to pay to use this plugin? =

No! The plugin is free to use. The Google Maps APIs it uses, however, do require you to setup an account on Google's Cloud Console. The process is easy and requires you also attaching a billing method to your account. Google provides a $200 monthly credit for usage of their APIs so you don't have to worry about paying anything unless you receive alot of orders on your store (upwards of 15,000 orders in a month). See [this step](https://lpacwp.com/docs/getting-started/google-cloud-console/getting-your-google-maps-api-key/#important-setting-up-billing-google-monthly-credit) in the setup guide for more details about how this works.

= Why are the plugin settings not in my language? = 

If the plugin settings are not in your language then it means translations for your language do not currently exist for the plugin. You are more than welcome to help translate the plugin into your language [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/map-location-picker-at-checkout-for-woocommerce/)
